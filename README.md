# Udacity Data Analyst AB Test Project 3
This is my repository for the project and files for the third project in the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program.

# Description
The goal of this project is to practice using A/B testing. The project is fairly in-depth and shows some of the issues that can occur.
Specifically, this project worked with the data from an e-commerce company and whether or not a new website was better than the old one.
I also learned quite a bit about the terms related to these areas of work such as: 'convert' or 'conversion rate' and 'click through'.
Lastly, this project allowed for continued practice using Python and working in the Jupyter Notebook environment.
